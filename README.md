**QSavings App (PiggyVest UI clone with tweaks)**

A **Savings App Ui design**, inspired by **PiggyVest** UI design.
Gonna probably try to switch some things up in this app,
and I'll try to change ui features I don't particularly like in the PiggyVest app.

**Features**
- . Basically the same UI features that piggyvest ui has.  
-  I'd try to create charts that display user savings performance. ðŸ“ˆðŸ“Š  
- . I'd try to create a mock machine learning model to simulate financial advise for users.

**TODO (Not right now tho ðŸ’¤ðŸ’¤):**
- STYLE THE APP TO IOS DESIGN SPECIFICS  
- SUPPORT WEB(APP SHOULD BE RESPONSIVE ON WEB  
-  ADD NICE COLOR THEME AND ABILITY TO SWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT COLOR SCHEMES  
- I'LL CHECK OUT COLOR PALETTE GENERATOR SITES FOR COLOR COMBINATION IDEAS)  
- I'll use ShowcaseView package to showcase the best features of the app.
